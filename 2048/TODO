Game works:
1. ask the size of the table n*n, how much n squares
2. initiate game with 2 cells filled
3. the player can move up/left/down/right -> WASD
4. every move fills a new square with a 2 or a 4, 75% prob. for 2 and 25% prob. for 4
5. when the player does a move, for all the squares, following the direction of the play,
	if there is another square with the same number, they join together and its value doubles
6. the game ends when the player has one square with the number 2048 in it, or if there is no possible movement that joins 2 squares

7. ask the player what's the goal number, must be a multiple of 2: [..., 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048]
8. after the player wins, ask if he wants to continue playing that game or begin a new one
9. allow the player to go back 1 play
